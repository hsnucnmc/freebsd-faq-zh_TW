What kind of hard drives does FreeBSD support?

FreeBSD supports EIDE, SATA, SCSI, and SAS drives (with a compatible controller; see the next section), and all drives using the original “Western Digital” interface (MFM, RLL, ESDI, and of course IDE). A few ESDI controllers that use proprietary interfaces may not work: stick to WD1002/3/6/7 interfaces and clones.

4.3.2.

Which SCSI or SAS controllers are supported?

See the complete list in the Hardware Notes for FreeBSD 12.0 or 10.4.

4.3.3.

What types of tape drives are supported?

FreeBSD supports all standard SCSI tape interfaces.

4.3.4.

Does FreeBSD support tape changers?

FreeBSD supports SCSI changers using the ch(4) device and the chio(1) command. The details of how to control the changer can be found in chio(1).

While AMANDA and some other products already understands changers, other applications only know how to move a tape from one point to another. In this case, keep track of which slot a tape is in and which slot the tape currently in the drive needs to go back to.

4.3.5.

Which CD-ROM and CD-RW drives are supported by FreeBSD?

Any SCSI drive connected to a supported controller is supported. Most ATAPI compatible IDE CD-ROMs are supported.

FreeBSD supports any ATAPI-compatible IDE CD-R or CD-RW drive.

FreeBSD also supports any SCSI CD-R or CD-RW drives. Install the sysutils/cdrtools port or package, then use cdrecord.
