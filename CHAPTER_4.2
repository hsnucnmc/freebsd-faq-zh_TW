4.2.1.

Does FreeBSD support architectures other than the x86?
FreeBSD支援除了x86之外的系統結構嗎?
Yes. FreeBSD divides support into multiple tiers. Tier 1 architectures, such as i386 or amd64; are fully supported. Tiers 2 and 3 are supported on a best-effort basis. 
A full explanation of the tier system is available in the Committer's Guide. A complete list of supported architectures can be found on the platforms page.
可，FreeBSD會分級支援。第一層完全支援，如i386、amd64。第二、三層會盡力支援，成敗不保證。關於層(tier)的系統在參與者指引有說明。而完整的結構支援表在論壇上已列出。
4.2.2.

Does FreeBSD support Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)?
FreeBSD支援對稱多處理(SMP)嗎?
FreeBSD supports symmetric multi-processor (SMP) on all non-embedded platforms (e.g, i386, amd64, etc.). SMP is also supported in arm and MIPS kernels, although some CPUs may not support this. FreeBSD's SMP implementation uses fine-grained locking, and performance scales nearly linearly with number of CPUs.

smp(4) has more details.

4.2.3.

What is microcode? How do I install Intel® CPU microcode updates?

Microcode is a method of programmatically implementing hardware level instructions. This allows for CPU bugs to be fixed without replacing the on board chip.

Install sysutils/devcpu-data, then add:

microcode_update_enable="YES"
to /etc/rc.conf
